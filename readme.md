# Hexagen

##  What is Hexagen?
Hexagen is a hexagon based game engine in Rust. Or will be. Eventually...

I started a hexagon engine in C#, however, I would like to transfer the project for Rust. The reason is to use [Bevy.](bevy.md)
This will let me offload a large amount of work centered around an ECS. I understand them theoretically and how their different implementations work. By using Bevy I can focus on rendering and the actual grid. Then eventually the game.
